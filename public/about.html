    My full name is ADELEYE SAMUEL ADENIYI, I am a Petroleum Engineering

    This has lead to me using my one year of national service to learn new
    skills like web development on Angela Yu's udemy platform, Advanced Ms Excel
    on APT learning's platform, and Product management, which I am also
    currently learning through my internship Technology Services Limited
    (STSL).<br />

    to problems by leveraging technology.
